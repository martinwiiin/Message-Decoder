# Message-Decoder

Given a few strings containing random characters and a list of instructions for how to decode the 
messages. The instructions are out of order and a priority queue is used to initiate the commands in 
the proper order. When every command is put into the priority queue in the correct order and each 
command is performed then the program will decode a message.

This program focusses on priority queues and binary search trees
